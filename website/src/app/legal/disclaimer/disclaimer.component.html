        W3Shop is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that people can use to create an online shop to sell digital
        items. This software is only a front end to access this information and is made up of free, public, open-source
        or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain
        or on Layer 2 technologies like Arbitrum. Your use of the W3Shop protocol involves various risks, including,
        but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the W3Shop protocol. Before using
        the W3Shop protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the W3Shop
        protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP through multiple
        email clients, you can access the W3Shop protocol through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are
        responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.

      <p>
        AS DESCRIBED IN THE W3SHOP PROTOCOL LICENSES, THE W3SHOP PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. Although the creator developed much of the initial code for the
        W3Shop protocol, he does not provide, own, or control the W3Shop protocol, which is run by smart contracts
        deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Upgrades and modifications to the protocol are managed in a
        community-driven way. No developer or entity involved in creating the W3Shop protocol will be liable for
        any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with
        other users of, the W3Shop protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive
        or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.
