      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h4>Will the code be open source?</h4>
      <p>Yes! As soon as the codebase has matured and we are on the Beta, the code will be open sourced on Github under
        the GPL v3.</p>

      <h4>Will it support other rollup techs like zkSync?</h4>
      <p>Definitely. The choice fell to Arbitrum because it was pretty established and had a good support from other
        tools that are required for the shop to work (Lit Protocol and Bundlr Network). As soon as those support zkSync
        too this rollup can be supported as well.</p>

      <h4>Will there be a token?</h4>
      <p>Nothing planned yet. Discuss on <a
          href="https://orbis.club/groups/kjzl6cwe1jw149efbqvnezbxg0iq8wmz6y23avcf3idff8zvu6zgx6297yb6xxd">Orbis
          Discussion Group</a> the potential use cases of a token.</p>

      <h4>Is there Vice Capital involved?</h4>
      <p>Nope, this is (or better will be, as the Github repository is not yet published) just a regular Open Source
        project. Completly developed by enthusiasts. So <b>in case</b> there will ever be a token at some point in time,
        it will not go to vice capital investors but fully to the community.</p>

      <h4>What about privacy? Why is there no Imprint or Cookie Banner?</h4>
      <p>TBD</p>
